DESCRIPTION
    Short-term memory for the AI agent. A key/value scratchpad stored in
    ~/.config/stm.json. Use freely to track current context, working
    variables, and temporary state.

    STM contents are automatically injected into the AI's context on
    each prompt. The AI can read and write STM to maintain working memory.

    Alarms are timed reminders that appear in the AI's context when due.
    Use them to track tasks that need follow-up.
