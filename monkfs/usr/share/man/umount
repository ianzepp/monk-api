NAME
    umount - unmount a filesystem

SYNOPSIS
    umount <mountpoint>

DESCRIPTION
    Unmounts a previously mounted filesystem and removes it from the
    saved mounts configuration.

    The mount is removed from:
    - The current session
    - ~/.config/mounts.json (so it won't restore on next login)

    System mounts (/api/*, /proc, /bin, etc.) cannot be unmounted.

EXAMPLES
    umount /dist
        Unmount the /dist local mount

    umount /home/root/active
        Unmount a find query mount

    umount ~/big-orders
        Unmount using ~ path expansion

FILES
    ~/.config/mounts.json
        Mount removed from this file on umount
