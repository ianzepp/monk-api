NAME
    delete_bulk - bulk delete records by ID

SYNOPSIS
    delete_bulk <model> [--file=<file>] [--dry-run]
    echo -e "id1\nid2" | delete_bulk <model>
    select id FROM users WHERE inactive=true | delete_bulk users

DESCRIPTION
    Deletes multiple records efficiently using a single API call.
    Input can be IDs (one per line), a JSON array of IDs, or a
    JSON array of objects with "id" fields.

    Unlike delete, this command:
    - Accepts multiple IDs at once
    - Uses direct API for better performance
    - Is designed for batch operations

OPTIONS
    --file=<path>
        Read IDs from file instead of stdin.

    --dry-run
        Validate input without deleting. Reports how many
        records would be deleted.

EXAMPLES
    echo -e "abc-123\ndef-456" | delete_bulk users
        Delete by piped IDs (newline-separated)

    delete_bulk products --file=ids.txt
        Delete from file of IDs

    select id FROM users WHERE status='inactive' | delete_bulk users
        Delete query results (pipe select output)

    delete_bulk orders --dry-run < ids.json
        Validate without deleting

INPUT FORMATS
    Newline-separated IDs:
        abc-123
        def-456
        ghi-789

    JSON array of IDs:
        ["abc-123", "def-456", "ghi-789"]

    JSON array of objects (id field extracted):
        [{"id": "abc-123"}, {"id": "def-456"}]

OUTPUT
    On success: "Deleted N records from <model>"
    On dry-run: "Dry run: would delete N records from <model>"

EXIT STATUS
    0   Success
    1   Error (invalid input, API error, etc.)
