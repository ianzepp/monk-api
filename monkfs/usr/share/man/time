NAME
    time - time command execution

SYNOPSIS
    time [options] <command> [args...]

DESCRIPTION
    Executes the given command and reports timing statistics
    when it completes. Times are written to stderr.

OPTIONS
    -p              POSIX format (seconds only)
    -v              Verbose output

OUTPUT
    real            Wall clock time (actual elapsed time)
    user            User CPU time (simulated)
    sys             System CPU time (simulated)

    Note: user and sys times are simulated approximations
    since actual CPU accounting is not available.

EXAMPLES
    time find /api/data
        Time a find operation

    time sleep 2
        Verify sleep duration

    time -p ls -la
        POSIX format output:
            real 0.015
            user 0.010
            sys 0.002

    time -v cat /api/data/users/*
        Verbose output with exit status

    time sh -c "find . | wc -l"
        Time a pipeline

EXIT STATUS
    Returns the exit status of the timed command.
