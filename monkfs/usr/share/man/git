NAME
    git - version control operations

SYNOPSIS
    git <subcommand> [options] [args]

DESCRIPTION
    Simplified git for the virtual filesystem. Downloads repository
    contents but does not track history or support commits.

SUBCOMMANDS
    clone <url> [destination]
            Clone a repository into the virtual filesystem.
            If no destination is specified, clones to /tmp/<repo-name>.

CLONE DETAILS
    Supported hosts:
        github.com      GitHub repositories
        gitlab.com      GitLab repositories

    URL formats:
        https://github.com/user/repo
        https://github.com/user/repo.git
        https://github.com/user/repo?ref=branch

    The ?ref=branch query parameter selects a specific branch.
    Default branch (main or master) is used if not specified.

    Note: Only public repositories are supported. The clone downloads
    file contents only - no .git directory or history is created.

EXAMPLES
    git clone https://github.com/user/repo
        Clone to /tmp/repo

    git clone https://github.com/user/repo /home/root/myrepo
        Clone to specific destination

    git clone https://github.com/user/repo?ref=develop
        Clone the develop branch

    git clone https://gitlab.com/user/project /tmp/project
        Clone from GitLab

LIMITATIONS
    - Public repositories only (no authentication)
    - No commit history or .git directory
    - No push, pull, or other git operations
    - Large repositories may be slow (GitHub API rate limits)
