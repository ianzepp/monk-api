NAME
    select - SQL-like query command

SYNOPSIS
    select <columns> from <model> [where <conditions>] [group by <columns>]
           [order by <column> [asc|desc]] [limit N]

DESCRIPTION
    Queries records using SQL-like syntax. Supports field selection,
    filtering, aggregation, grouping, ordering, and limiting.

    Unlike traditional SQL, there's no need to connect to a database -
    the entire platform IS a database.
