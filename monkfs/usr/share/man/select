    select - SQL-like query command

SYNOPSIS
    select <columns> from <model> [where <conditions>] [group by <columns>]
           [order by <column> [asc|desc]] [limit N]

DESCRIPTION
    Queries records using SQL-like syntax. Supports field selection,
    filtering, aggregation, grouping, ordering, and limiting.

    Unlike traditional SQL, there's no need to connect to a database -
    the entire platform IS a database.

    all                 All fields (preferred, avoids shell glob)
    *                   All fields (requires quoting: '*' or \*)
    field1, field2      Specific fields
    count(*)            Count all records
    count(field)        Count non-null values
    sum(field)          Sum of numeric field
    avg(field)          Average of numeric field
    min(field)          Minimum value
    max(field)          Maximum value

WHERE OPERATORS
    =, ==               Equals
    !=, <>              Not equals
    <, >, <=, >=        Comparison
    like                Pattern match (% wildcard)
    ilike               Case-insensitive pattern match
