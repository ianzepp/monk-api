NAME
    find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

SYNOPSIS
    find [path...] [expression]

DESCRIPTION
    Recursively descends directory trees, evaluating an expression
    for each file. By default, prints paths of all files found.

PRIMARIES
    -name <pattern>     Match filename (supports *, ?)
    -iname <pattern>    Case-insensitive -name
    -path <pattern>     Match full path
    -ipath <pattern>    Case-insensitive -path
    -type <c>           File type: f (file), d (directory), l (symlink)
    -maxdepth <n>       Descend at most n directory levels
    -mindepth <n>       Ignore first n directory levels
    -empty              Match empty files or directories

ACTIONS
    -print              Print path with newline (default)
    -print0             Print path with NUL terminator
    -exec <cmd> {} \;   Execute command for each match
    -delete             Delete matched files

OPERATORS
    ! <expr>            Negate expression
    -not <expr>         Same as !
    -a, -and            AND (implicit between primaries)
    -o, -or             OR

    find .
        List all files recursively

    find /api/data -type f
        Find only files

    find . -name "*.json"
        Find by filename pattern

    find . -iname "readme*"
        Case-insensitive name match

    find . -name "*.log" -delete
        Find and delete log files

    find . -type f -exec cat {} \;
        Cat each file found

    find . -print0 | xargs -0 rm
        Safe handling of special characters
