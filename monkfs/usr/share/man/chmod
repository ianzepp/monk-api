NAME
    chmod - change file mode bits

SYNOPSIS
    chmod <mode> <file>...

DESCRIPTION
    Changes the file mode (permissions) of each given file.

    Mode can be specified as:

    Octal notation:
        Three or four octal digits (0-7). Each digit represents
        permissions for owner, group, and others respectively.

        4 = read (r)
        2 = write (w)
        1 = execute (x)

        Example: 755 = rwxr-xr-x

    Symbolic notation:
        [ugoa][+-=][rwx]

        Who:
            u = user (owner)
            g = group
            o = others
            a = all (default if omitted)

        Operation:
            + = add permission
            - = remove permission
            = = set exactly

        Permissions:
            r = read
            w = write
            x = execute

EXAMPLES
    chmod 755 script.sh
        Set rwxr-xr-x (owner: full, others: read+execute)

    chmod 644 file.txt
        Set rw-r--r-- (owner: read+write, others: read)

    chmod u+x script.sh
        Add execute permission for owner

    chmod go-w file.txt
        Remove write permission from group and others

    chmod a=r secret.txt
        Set read-only for everyone

NOTES
    Only works on filesystems that support permissions:
    - Home directories (/home/*)
    - Temp files (/tmp/*)
    - Local mounts (mount -t local)

    API mounts (/api/*) will return "Read-only file system".
