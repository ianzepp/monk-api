SYNOPSIS
    update <path> [field=value ...]
    update <path> '<json>'

DESCRIPTION
    Updates existing records at the specified path. The path should
    point to a specific record (include the record ID) or use "."

    command line, or by piping JSON data to stdin.

        Update a specific record by ID

    update . status=active
        Update current record (when in a record directory)

    update /api/data/users/abc-123 '{"name":"New Name","status":"active"}'
        Update with inline JSON

        Update from JSON via stdin
