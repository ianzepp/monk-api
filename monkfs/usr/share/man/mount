NAME
    mount - mount filesystems or display mounts

SYNOPSIS
    mount
    mount -t TYPE [-r] <args...> <target>

DESCRIPTION
    Without arguments, displays all mounted filesystems in Linux-style format.
    With arguments, mounts a filesystem at the specified target.

    Mounts are automatically saved to ~/.config/mounts.json and restored
    on next login. Use umount to remove a saved mount.

OPTIONS
    -t TYPE     Mount type (local, find)
    -r          Mount read-only (--readonly) [local only]

MOUNT TYPES
    local       Mount a host filesystem directory
                Usage: mount -t local <source> <target>
                Source: absolute path on host system
                Target: virtual filesystem path

    find        Mount a database query as a virtual directory
                Usage: mount -t find <model> <query-json> <target>
                Model: name of the model to query
                Query: JSON object with where, order, limit, select

OUTPUT FORMAT
    /dev/TYPE on /path (details)

    Device types:
        /dev/data       CRUD operations (/api/data)
        /dev/describe   Model schemas (/api/describe)
        /dev/filter     Saved filters (/api/find)
        /dev/trashed    Soft-deleted records (/api/trashed)
        /dev/proc       Process table (/proc)
        /dev/bin        Built-in commands (/bin)
        /dev/system     System info (/system)
        /dev/mem        In-memory storage (/tmp)
        /dev/fs         Database storage (fallback)
        /dev/local      Host filesystem mount
        /dev/find       Query mount

EXAMPLES
    mount
        List all mounts

    mount -t local /path/to/dist /dist
        Mount host directory at /dist

    mount -t local -r /var/log /logs
        Mount read-only

    mount -t find accounts '{"where":{"active":true}}' ~/active
        Mount active accounts query

    mount -t find orders '{"where":{"total":{"$gt":1000}},"limit":100}' ~/big-orders
        Mount filtered orders with limit

FILES
    ~/.config/mounts.json
        Saved mount configurations, restored on login

NOTES
    Use absolute paths for local mount sources. The ~ character expands
    to the virtual home directory, not the host home directory.

    Find mounts are read-only. To modify records, use /api/data directly.

SECURITY
    Local mounts have path traversal protection.
    Symlinks pointing outside the source directory are blocked.

SEE ALSO
    umount, ls, cat, select
