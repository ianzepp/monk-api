SOURCE(1)                   User Commands                   SOURCE(1)

NAME
       source - execute commands from a file

SYNOPSIS
       source file
       . file

DESCRIPTION
       Read and execute commands from file in the current shell
       environment. The file does not need to be executable.

       Commands are executed in the current session, so any changes
       to environment variables (via export) affect the session.

       Lines starting with # are treated as comments and ignored.
       The shebang line (#!/bin/monksh) is also ignored if present.

       The special variable $? contains the exit code of the last
       executed command.

OPTIONS
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       Returns the exit status of the last command executed, or
       1 if the file cannot be read.

EXAMPLES
       source ~/.profile
              Execute login profile.

       . /scripts/setup.sh
              Execute setup script using dot notation.

       Create a script:
              echo 'export FOO=bar' > ~/test.sh
              echo 'echo $FOO' >> ~/test.sh
              source ~/test.sh
