NAME
    realpath - print resolved absolute pathname

SYNOPSIS
    realpath [options] <file...>

DESCRIPTION
    Expands all symbolic links and resolves references to
    . and .. to produce a canonical absolute path.

OPTIONS
    -e              All path components must exist
    -m              No path components need exist
    -L              Resolve .. before symlinks (logical)
    -P              Resolve symlinks first (physical, default)
    -q              Quiet (suppress errors)
    -s              Don't expand symlinks
    --relative-to=<dir>     Print relative to directory
    --relative-base=<dir>   Print relative if descendant

EXAMPLES
    realpath .
        /current/working/directory

    realpath ../foo/bar
        /parent/foo/bar

    realpath -e /api/data/users/123
        Verify path exists

    realpath --relative-to=/api /api/data/users
        data/users

    realpath -s ./link
        Don't follow symlinks

EXIT STATUS
    0       Success
    1       Error (path doesn't exist with -e)
