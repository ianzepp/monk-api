NAME
    delete - remove records (soft delete)

SYNOPSIS
    delete <path>

DESCRIPTION
    Removes records at the specified path. Records are soft-deleted,
    meaning they are moved to the trash and can be restored later.

    The path should point to a specific record (include the record ID)
    or use "." for the current directory if already in a record context.

EXAMPLES
    delete /api/data/users/abc-123
        Delete a specific record by ID

    delete .
        Delete current record (when in a record directory)

    delete users/abc-123
        Delete using relative path

TRASH AND RESTORE
    Soft-deleted records are moved to /api/trashed/<model>/.

    To view trashed records:
        ls /api/trashed/users

    To restore a trashed record:
        Use the restore API endpoint

    To permanently delete:
        Use the permanent delete API endpoint
