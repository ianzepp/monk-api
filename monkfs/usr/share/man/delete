NAME
    delete - remove a single record (soft delete)

SYNOPSIS
    delete <model> <id>
    delete .

DESCRIPTION
    Removes a single record. Specify the model and record ID, or use "."
    when in a record directory (/api/data/<model>/<id>).

    Records are soft-deleted, meaning they are moved to the trash and
    can be restored later.

    For bulk deletes, use delete_bulk instead.

EXAMPLES
    delete users abc-123
        Delete a specific record

    delete .
        Delete current record (when in /api/data/users/abc-123)

TRASH AND RESTORE
    Soft-deleted records are moved to /api/trashed/<model>/.

    To view trashed records:
        ls /api/trashed/users

    To restore a trashed record:
        Use the restore API endpoint

    To permanently delete:
        Use the permanent delete API endpoint
