NAME
    kill - terminate a process

SYNOPSIS
    kill PID
    kill -9 PID

DESCRIPTION
    Sends a termination signal to the specified process.
    The process must belong to the current tenant.

    The -9 flag is accepted for compatibility but all
    terminations are immediate (there is no graceful vs
    forced distinction).

ARGUMENTS
    PID     Process ID to terminate (from ps output)

EXIT STATUS
    0       Process was successfully terminated
    1       Error (no such process, already terminated, etc.)

EXAMPLES
    kill 42
        Terminate process with PID 42

    kill -9 42
        Same as above (force flag accepted but ignored)

    ps | grep export
    kill 15
        Find and kill an export process

NOTES
    Only processes in 'running' or 'pending' status can be killed.
    Killing a process sets its status to 'killed'.
