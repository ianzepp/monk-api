NAME
    ltm - long-term memory storage

SYNOPSIS
    ltm
    ltm add <text>
    ltm search <query>
    ltm list [limit]
    ltm delete <id>

DESCRIPTION
    Long-term memory for the AI agent. Append-only storage backed by the
    database with full-text search. Use for durable insights, learned
    facts, user preferences, and anything worth remembering permanently.

    Unlike STM (short-term memory), LTM persists across sessions and is
    never automatically cleared. Use coalesce to consolidate STM insights
    into LTM.

COMMANDS
    (none), list [N]    List recent memories (default: 20)
    add <text>          Append a new memory
    search <query>      Full-text search memories
    delete <id>         Delete a memory by ID (first 8 chars sufficient)

FULL-TEXT SEARCH
    The search command uses PostgreSQL's full-text search (tsvector) or
    SQLite's LIKE for matching. Search terms are matched against the
    content of all memories owned by the current user.

EXAMPLES
    ltm add "User prefers TypeScript over JavaScript"
        Save a learned preference

    ltm add "Auth system uses JWT with 24h expiry"
        Save a technical fact

    ltm search "auth"
        Find memories about authentication

    ltm search "preferences"
        Find stored preferences

    ltm list
        Show 20 most recent memories

    ltm list 50
        Show 50 most recent memories

    ltm delete abc123
        Delete a specific memory

OUTPUT FORMAT
    Memories are displayed as:
        [<id>] <date>: <content>

    Example:
        [abc12345] 2024-01-15: User prefers verbose output

EXIT STATUS
    0       Success
    1       Error or no matches found
