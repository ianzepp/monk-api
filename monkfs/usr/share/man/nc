NAME
       nc - netcat: arbitrary TCP connections

SYNOPSIS
       nc [-zv] [-w timeout] host port

DESCRIPTION
       Open a TCP connection to the specified host and port.
       Data from stdin is sent to the remote host, and data
       received is written to stdout.

OPTIONS
       -z         Zero-I/O mode: just check if port is open
       -v         Verbose: print connection status to stderr
       -w SECS    Connection timeout in seconds (default: 10)

EXIT STATUS
       0    Connection succeeded (or port is open in -z mode)
       1    Connection failed or timed out

EXAMPLES
       nc -z localhost 3000
              Check if port 3000 is open.

       nc -zv localhost 3000
              Check port with verbose output.

       nc localhost 80
              Connect to HTTP port interactively.

       echo "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n" | nc localhost 80
              Send HTTP request via pipe.

       nc -w 5 api.example.com 443
              Connect with 5 second timeout.

NOTES
       Listen mode (-l) is not implemented.
       Use curl(1) for HTTP requests with better handling.
