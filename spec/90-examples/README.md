# 90-examples: Example and Documentation Tests

**Priority**: NICE TO HAVE
**Coverage**: 0% (No tests implemented)
**Status**: Specification only

## Critical / Smoke Tests

### Missing Tests (No critical tests - examples for developers)
- N/A - Examples serve as living documentation, not production validation

## Additional Tests

### Missing Coverage
- Enhanced test helper usage patterns
- Template system demonstrations
- Multi-fixture composition patterns
- Phase 4 end-to-end workflows
- Migration utility examples
- Performance monitoring patterns
- Advanced testing techniques demonstrations

## Notes

- Tests serve as both functional validation and living documentation
- Show developers how to use testing infrastructure effectively
- Demonstrate API usage patterns
- Not critical for production functionality
- Valuable for developer onboarding and best practices
