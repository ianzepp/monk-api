NAME
    watch - execute a command periodically

SYNOPSIS
    watch [options] <command> [args...]

DESCRIPTION
    Runs a command repeatedly, clearing the screen and displaying
    the output. Useful for monitoring changing data.

OPTIONS
    -n <seconds>    Interval between executions (default: 2)
    -d              Highlight differences from previous output
    -t              Turn off the header (no title)
    -e              Exit if command returns non-zero
    -g              Exit when output changes
    -c              Interpret ANSI color sequences

HEADER
    By default, watch displays a header showing:
    - The interval and command being run
    - The current date and time

EXAMPLES
    watch ps
        Monitor processes every 2 seconds

    watch -n 5 ls -l
        List directory every 5 seconds

    watch -d cat /proc/1/status
        Monitor process, highlight changes

    watch -n 1 date
        Show updating clock every second

    watch -e ping /health
        Monitor health, stop on failure

    watch -g cat /api/data/config
        Exit when config file changes

    watch -t -n 0.5 cat /proc/loadavg
        Fast refresh, no header

SIGNALS
    Ctrl+C          Stop watching and exit

EXIT STATUS
    0               Exited due to -g (output changed)
    Non-zero        Command exit code (with -e)
    130             Interrupted (Ctrl+C)

NOTES
    The command is passed to the shell, so pipelines and
    redirections work as expected.

    Minimum practical interval is about 0.1 seconds.
