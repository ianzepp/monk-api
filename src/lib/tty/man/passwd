NAME
    passwd - change user password

SYNOPSIS
    passwd [username]
    echo "newpassword" | passwd [username]

DESCRIPTION
    Changes the password for a user account.

    When run without piped input, passwd enters interactive mode
    and prompts for the new password twice for confirmation.

    Non-root users can only change their own password.
    Root users can change any user's password.

    Passwords are stored using Argon2id hashing.
    Minimum password length is 4 characters.

ARGUMENTS
    username
            Target user whose password to change (root only).
            If omitted, changes your own password.

INTERACTIVE MODE
    When run without piped input:

        $ passwd
        New password: ********
        Confirm password: ********
        passwd: password updated for root

    Passwords are not echoed to the terminal.

PIPED MODE
    For scripting, pipe the password via stdin:

        echo "mysecretpass" | passwd
        echo "mysecretpass" | passwd bob

EXAMPLES
    passwd
        Interactive password change for yourself

    passwd bob
        Interactive password change for bob (root only)

    echo "secretpass" | passwd
        Non-interactive password change

EXIT STATUS
    0   Password changed successfully
    1   Error (permission denied, user not found, mismatch, etc.)
