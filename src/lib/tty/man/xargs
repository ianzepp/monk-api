NAME
    xargs - build and execute commands from stdin

SYNOPSIS
    <input> | xargs [options] <command> [args...]

DESCRIPTION
    Reads items from stdin and executes the specified command with
    those items as arguments. By default, items are split on whitespace.

OPTIONS
    -0              Input items are NUL-separated (use with find -print0)
    -d <delim>      Use delimiter instead of whitespace
    -I <replace>    Replace string in command (implies -n 1)
    -n <max>        Use at most max arguments per command invocation
    -t              Print commands before executing (trace mode)
    -r              Don't run command if stdin is empty
    -L <max>        Use at most max lines per command invocation
    -P <max>        Run up to max processes in parallel

EXAMPLES
    find . -type f | xargs cat
        Cat all files found

    find . -print0 | xargs -0 rm
        Safe delete with NUL separator (handles spaces in names)

    echo "a b c" | xargs -n1 echo
        One argument per command:
            echo a
            echo b
            echo c

    find . | xargs -I {} cp {} /backup/
        Use replacement string

    find . -type f | xargs -P4 -n10 gzip
        Parallel execution: 4 processes, 10 files each

    echo "1,2,3" | xargs -d, echo
        Split by comma

    find . -name "*.txt" | xargs -t wc -l
        Trace mode shows commands

EXIT STATUS
    Returns the exit code of the last command executed,
    or 0 if -r was specified and stdin was empty.
