NAME
    timeout - run a command with a time limit

SYNOPSIS
    timeout DURATION COMMAND [ARGS...]

DESCRIPTION
    Runs the specified command and terminates it if it is still
    running after the specified duration.

    Duration can be specified as:
    - 5 or 5s   - 5 seconds
    - 500ms     - 500 milliseconds
    - 1m        - 1 minute
    - 1h        - 1 hour

EXIT STATUS
    If the command times out, exit status is 124.
    Otherwise, the exit status is that of the command.

EXAMPLES
    timeout 5s sleep 10
        Run sleep for max 5 seconds (will timeout)

    timeout 1m find /api/data
        Allow find up to 1 minute

    timeout 30s cat /api/data/users/123
        Read with 30 second timeout

NOTES
    The command is not forcibly killed - the timeout races
    against command completion.
