NAME
    mount - mount filesystems or display mounts

SYNOPSIS
    mount
    mount -t TYPE [-r] <source> <target>

DESCRIPTION
    Without arguments, displays all mounted filesystems.
    With arguments, mounts a filesystem at the specified target.

OPTIONS
    -t TYPE     Mount type (currently: local)
    -r          Mount read-only (--readonly)

MOUNT TYPES
    local       Mount a host filesystem directory
                Source: absolute path on host system
                Target: virtual filesystem path

EXAMPLES
    mount
        List all mounts

    mount -t local /path/to/dist /dist
        Mount host directory at /dist

    mount -t local -r /home/user/projects /projects
        Mount read-only

NOTES
    Use absolute paths for the source. The ~ character expands to
    the virtual home directory, not the host home directory.

SECURITY
    Local mounts have path traversal protection.
    Symlinks pointing outside the source directory are blocked.

SEE ALSO
    umount, ls, cd
