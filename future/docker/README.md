# Docker Configuration - Future Development

This directory contains Docker-related configuration files that have been moved out of the main RC1 release due to their current unstable state.

## Files Moved

### Dockerfile
- Standard Docker container configuration for the Monk API
- Based on Node.js runtime
- **Current State**: Basic functionality present but needs optimization
- **Issues**: Container size not optimized, build process needs refinement

### Dockerfile.with-templates  
- Extended Dockerfile that includes the fixture template system
- **Current State**: Experimental - depends on fixtures system
- **Issues**: Tightly coupled to unstable fixture system

### docker-compose.yml
- Standard development Docker Compose configuration
- **Current State**: Basic setup for API + PostgreSQL
- **Issues**: Configuration needs validation and optimization

### docker-compose.dev-with-data.yml
- Development Docker Compose with fixture data preloading
- **Current State**: Experimental - includes template system
- **Issues**: Depends on fixture system being removed

## NPM Scripts Removed

The following Docker-related npm scripts were present in package.json:
- `docker:dev` - Docker Compose development environment
- `docker:dev:daemon` - Docker Compose development in background  
- `docker:dev:with-data` - Development with fixture data
- `docker:dev:with-data:daemon` - Development with fixture data in background
- `docker:prod` - Production Docker environment
- `docker:stop` - Stop Docker Compose services
- `docker:stop:with-data` - Stop development with data services
- `docker:clean` - Clean Docker containers and volumes
- `docker:clean:with-data` - Clean development with data environment
- `docker:logs` - View Docker container logs

## Future Development Plans

1. **Container Optimization**: Optimize Dockerfile for smaller image size and faster builds
2. **Multi-stage Builds**: Implement proper multi-stage builds for production
3. **Security Hardening**: Add security best practices to Docker configurations
4. **Environment Variables**: Clean up environment variable handling
5. **Documentation**: Add comprehensive Docker setup and deployment guides
6. **CI/CD Integration**: Add Docker-based CI/CD pipeline configurations

## Usage Notes

These Docker configurations were functional but not production-ready for the RC1 release. They can be restored and improved for future versions once the core API reaches stable state.

To restore for development:
1. Move files back to project root
2. Add npm scripts back to package.json  
3. Test and validate configurations
4. Update documentation
